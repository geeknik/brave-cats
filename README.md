# 🐱 Quantum Cat Overlay Engine (QCOE)

Transform your browsing reality through procedurally generated feline manifestations.

## 🧬 Core Paradigm

QCOE introduces a novel approach to web content augmentation through quantum-inspired procedural cat generation. Each image encounter triggers a unique feline materialization, creating a personalized reality tunnel of cat-enhanced digital experiences.

## 🛠 Implementation Vectors

- **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Fully aligned with Chrome/Brave extension architecture
- **Quantum-Inspired Generation**: Non-deterministic cat manifestation algorithms
- **Non-Destructive Operations**: Original image integrity preservation
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal reality-warping overhead
- **Cross-Origin Protocols**: Secure cat manifestation across domains

## 🧪 Development Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Understanding of quantum mechanics (optional but recommended)
- Basic knowledge of feline topology
- Appreciation for digital surrealism

## 🚀 Reality Integration Steps

1. Clone the quantum repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/brave-cats.git
```

2. Navigate to `brave://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer Mode (collapse classical reality)
4. Load unpacked extension (manifest quantum state)
