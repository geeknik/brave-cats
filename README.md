# 🐱 Quantum Cat Overlay Engine (QCOE) for Brave

## 𝚅𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗
Transform the digital landscape through procedurally generated feline entropy. Every image becomes a canvas for mathematical felinity, creating a uniquely surreal browsing experience.

## 𝙾𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠
QCOE is a Manifest V3 extension for Brave that dynamically overlays procedurally generated cats onto every image you encounter. Each cat is unique, generated through advanced algorithmic processes, ensuring no two users experience the same feline manifestation.

## 𝚃𝚎𝚌𝚑𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚕 𝙵𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜
- MV3-compliant architecture
- Non-destructive image manipulation
- Deterministic cat generation algorithms
- Performance-optimized rendering pipeline
- Configurable cat parameters
- Cross-origin resource handling
